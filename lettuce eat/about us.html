<body>
  <p>We are a small group of vegans and vegetarians who deeply care about animals and the planet.
  We believe whatever we consume does have a massive impact on our health and the environment.
  We know transitioning into vegetarianism and/or veganism can be hard for some people, this is one of the main reasons for why we created Lettuce Eat.</p>
  <p>We want other vegans and vegetarians like us to be able to experience the taste of meat and fast food without actually consuming them.
  This is a great alternative to consuming meat and all restaurants listed on our website provide great alternatives to meat and also cook the foods listed with healthy ingredients.
  We believe that our website will greatly inform you of any information you might need regarding any sort of fast food you are interested in checking out.</p>
  <p>
  <p>This is just the veganning of a radishing experience!</p>
  <p>We are rooting for you!</p>
