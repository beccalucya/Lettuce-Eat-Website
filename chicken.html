  <h3> Reviews </h3>
  <p> "Temple of Hackney provides the <strong>BEST</strong> vegan chicken that i've ever tasted" - Bethany P, Clapham </p>
  <p> "I was very impressed with the quality of the food but it was a bit more expensive than I thought it would be... Would probably go again though." - Jeremy, Sutton </p>
  <p> "I am so glad these eateries have opened in London, I don't know where I'd be without them now! Although I have to travel from Surrey to get my fix of this tasty seitan, it's so worth it!!" - Harry W, Reigate </p>
